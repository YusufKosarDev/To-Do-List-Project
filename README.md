**To-Do List Project**


A compact, single-page To-Do List application that allows users to:

Add new tasks

Mark tasks as completed

Delete tasks

Manage daily activities efficiently


**📝 What Does It Do?**

The app helps users keep track of their daily tasks in a simple and clean interface:

Add Task: Users can type a task into the input field and click the “Add” button.

Complete Task: Tasks can be marked as completed using a checkbox.

Delete Task: Tasks can be removed individually using the delete (×) button.

Real-time Updates: The list updates instantly without refreshing the page.

The design focuses on simplicity, usability, and minimalism.


**⚙️ How Does It Work?**

Single-page structure: Built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

Event-driven logic:

A click event listener adds new tasks.

Checkbox events toggle completed state.

Delete button removes tasks dynamically.

DOM manipulation: Tasks are created and appended dynamically to the list.

Lightweight implementation: No external libraries — pure JavaScript and modern CSS styling.


**🎓 What I Learned?**

Handling user input and form validation.

Working with event listeners in JavaScript.

Dynamically creating and removing DOM elements.

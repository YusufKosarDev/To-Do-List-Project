**Habit Tracker App Project**

This is a simple and practical Habit Tracker Application built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps users build better routines by tracking daily habits and monitoring their progress over time.

📝 What Does It Do?

The Habit Tracker App provides a clean and easy-to-use interface for managing daily habits.

Allows users to add new habits

Displays a list of tracked habits

Lets users mark habits as completed

Updates habit status dynamically

Option to reset or manage habits

⚙️ How Does It Work?

The project is built using core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and state management:

HTML Structure: Defines the layout for habit input, habit list, and action buttons

CSS Styling: Provides a clean and responsive UI for better user experience

DOM Selection: Elements are selected using querySelector and getElementById

Event Listeners: User actions (adding, completing, deleting habits) are handled with click events

Application Logic: Habits are stored and updated using JavaScript arrays and variables

🎓 What Have I Learned?

By building this project, I improved my understanding of:

DOM Manipulation: Dynamically adding and updating habit items

Event Handling: Responding to user interactions in real time

JavaScript Logic: Managing application state and user data

UI Feedback: Visually indicating completed habits

Clean Code Structure: Writing readable and maintainable vanilla JavaScript
